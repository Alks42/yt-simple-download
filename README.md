If you are looking for more complex program with variety of options like extracting mp3 or downloading  subtitles - try [this great repo](https://github.com/oleksis/youtube-dl-gui).
## Requirements
Tkinter, tkinter.ttk and ytl_dlp.
## Config file
Contain 3 changeable  parameters:
- 1st line - width, height and position on the screen.
- 2d line - destination folder
- 3d line - formats. There are plenty of them but 90% of youtube videos use mp4 for video and m4a for audio. 
### Is there any .exe file?
Yep, just look to the right to releases section.
